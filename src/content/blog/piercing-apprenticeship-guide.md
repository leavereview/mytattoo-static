A piercing apprenticeship is the gateway to a professional career in body modification. Unlike tattooing, where self-taught artists exist (though it's not recommended), piercing requires hands-on training under experienced professionals. This guide covers everything you need to know.

## What Is a Piercing Apprenticeship?

A piercing apprenticeship is a structured training program where you learn under a licensed, experienced piercer. It typically lasts 6 months to 2 years and covers:

- Anatomy and physiology
- Sterilization and cross-contamination prevention
- Jewelry selection and fitting
- Piercing techniques for various locations
- Client care and consultation
- Business and professionalism
