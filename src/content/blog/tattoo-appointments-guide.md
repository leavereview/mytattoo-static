- Check in at reception
- Complete any required paperwork
- Show ID and sign consent forms
- Settle any remaining payment or [deposits](/blog/tattoo-deposit-guide/)

### The Consultation Process

Even if you've discussed your tattoo before, your artist will likely:

- Review the design together
- Show you the stencil or drawing
- Discuss any final adjustments
- Explain the process and expected duration
- Answer any last questions

**This is your last chance to make changes.** Speak up if something isn't quite right. Good artists want you to love your tattoo.

### Stencil Placement

**The artist will:**
- Prepare and shave the area
- Apply the stencil to your skin
- Let you check the placement
- Make adjustments as needed
- Have you approve the final position

**Take your time with placement:**
- Look at it from multiple angles
- Check in a mirror
- Sit and stand (if relevant)
- Ask for repositioning if needed

Once you approve, the tattooing begins.

### During the Tattoo Session

**What to expect:**
- Initial outlining (often most uncomfortable)
- Shading and filling
- Colour work (if applicable)
- Final details and touch-ups

**Managing discomfort:**
- Pain varies by location and personal tolerance
- Breathing techniques help
- Distraction (music, podcasts, conversation)
- Short breaks if needed
- Communication with your artist about pain levels

**Sensation varies by area:**

| Location | Typical Sensation |
|----------|-------------------|
| Outer arm | Mild to moderate |
| Inner arm | Moderate |
| Ribs/chest | More intense |
| Spine/back | Moderate to intense |
| Hands/feet | More intense |
| Thigh (outer) | Mild to moderate |

**Staying comfortable:**
- Communicate openly with your artist
- Ask for breaks when needed
- Stay hydrated
- Snack during longer sessions
- Don't be embarrassed about needing pauses

### Session Length

**Typical durations:**

| Tattoo Size | Approximate Time |
|-------------|------------------|
| Small (coin-sized) | 30-60 minutes |
| Medium (palm-sized) | 2-4 hours |
| Large (half sleeve) | 6-8+ hours |
| Full sleeve | Multiple sessions |

Larger pieces are often split across multiple sessions to manage healing and comfort.

## After Your Appointment

### Immediate Aftercare

Your artist will:
- Clean the tattoo area
- Apply healing ointment
- Cover with bandage or second-skin wrap
- Explain aftercare instructions

**First 24-48 hours:**
- Leave initial wrap on as instructed (2-24 hours depending on type)
- Remove wrap gently following instructions
- Wash gently with fragrance-free soap
- Pat dry (never rub)
- Apply thin layer of recommended ointment
- Don't re-bandage unless instructed

### Healing Timeline

**Week 1:**
- Redness and swelling normal
- May weep plasma or ink (normal)
- Keep clean and moisturised
- Avoid submerging in water

**Weeks 2-3:**
- Peeling and flaking begins
- **Do not pick or scratch**
- Skin may feel tight and itchy
- Continue gentle moisturising

**Weeks 4-6:**
- Outer healing largely complete
- Colour may look lighter temporarily
- Deep healing continues internally
- Gradually return to normal activities

**Full healing:**
- Skin fully heals in 2-3 months
- Sun protection important for first year
- Touch-ups can be done after full healing

### What to Avoid While Healing

**First 2 weeks:**
- Swimming (pool, ocean, bath)
- Saunas and steam rooms
- Direct sunlight
- Tight clothing rubbing the area
- Excessive sweating
- Picking at scabs or peeling skin

**First month:**
- Tanning beds
- Sun exposure without protection
- Harsh chemicals on the area
- Scratching (no matter how itchy)

### When to Contact Your Artist

Reach out if you notice:
- Excessive redness spreading beyond the tattoo
- Unusual swelling after initial days
- Signs of infection (pus, hot to touch, fever)
- Allergic reaction symptoms
- Significant colour loss during healing
- Any concerning changes

Most concerns are normal healing variations, but when in doubt, ask.

## Follow-Up Appointments

### Touch-Ups

Many artists offer free touch-ups within a certain period (often 3-6 months):

- Wait until fully healed (2-3 months minimum)
- Book in advance as availability fills
- Touch-ups address minor imperfections
- Not all tattoos need touch-ups

### Multi-Session Pieces

Large tattoos often require multiple appointments:

- Sessions spaced 2-4 weeks apart for healing
- Each session builds on the previous
- Total timeline can span months
- Consistent aftercare between sessions

### Future Additions

Planning to expand your tattoo?
- Discuss long-term vision with your artist
- Consider how pieces will connect
- Allow proper healing between sessions
- Same aftercare applies each time

## Tips for the Best Experience
