A well-designed tattoo booking form saves time, reduces back-and-forth communication, and sets proper expectations before clients arrive. Whether you use paper forms, online forms, or [booking software](/tattoo-booking-software/), knowing what information to collect is essential.

This guide covers what to include in your tattoo booking form and why each element matters.

## Why Booking Forms Matter

### Benefits of Good Forms

**For artists:**
- Receive complete information upfront
- Reduce consultation time
- Screen out unsuitable requests
- Prepare designs efficiently
- Professional presentation

**For clients:**
- Clear expectations set
- Organised booking process
- Time to consider details
- Confidence in studio professionalism

### Paper vs. Digital

**Paper forms:**
- Simple to create
- No technology required
- Easy in-person completion
- Storage and organisation challenges

**Digital forms:**
- Automatic organisation
- Easy searching and retrieval
- Pre-appointment completion
- Integration with booking systems
- Environmental benefits

## Essential Form Sections

### Contact Information

**Required fields:**
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Date of birth (for age verification)

**Why each matters:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Full name | Legal records, identification |
| Phone | Appointment reminders, quick contact |
| Email | Confirmations, reference sharing |
| Date of birth | Age verification (must be 18+) |

**Best practice:**
Request preferred contact method and best times to reach them.

### Tattoo Details

**Design information:**
- Design concept/description
- Size (approximate dimensions)
- Placement (body location)
- Style preference (traditional, realistic, etc.)
- Colour or black and grey

**Reference images:**
- Allow image upload or ask for links
- Request multiple angles if applicable
- Ask about inspiration sources

**Example questions:**
- "Describe your tattoo idea in as much detail as possible"
- "What approximate size are you thinking? (e.g., 3" x 4")"
- "Where on your body would you like this tattoo?"
- "Do you prefer colour or black and grey?"

### Scheduling Preferences

**Availability questions:**
- Preferred days of the week
- Preferred times
- How soon they want to schedule
- Any dates to avoid

**Flexibility indicators:**
- How flexible is their schedule?
- Can they take weekday appointments?
- Lead time acceptable?

### Medical and Health Information

**Important disclosures:**
- Skin conditions
- Allergies (especially to latex, ink, aftercare products)
- Medical conditions affecting healing
- Medications (blood thinners, etc.)
- Pregnancy or nursing status

**Why this matters:**
Health information affects safety and results. Some conditions require precautions or may contraindicate tattooing.

**Sample questions:**
- "Do you have any skin conditions (eczema, psoriasis, keloids)?"
- "Are you allergic to any products, including latex?"
- "Are you currently taking any medications?"
- "Are you pregnant or nursing?"

### Previous Tattoo Experience

**Helpful context:**
- First tattoo or experienced?
- Previous reactions to tattooing?
- Existing tattoos to work around or connect with?
- Previous cover-up or correction needs?

**Why ask:**
Experienced clients have different needs than first-timers. Previous reactions inform precautions.

## Optional But Valuable Fields

### Budget Indication

**Approaches:**
- Open text field for budget
- Ranges to select (£100-£200, £200-£400, etc.)

**Benefit:**
Ensures realistic expectations before time is invested.
