    question: "What software do tattoo artists use?",
    answer: "Professional tattoo artists use specialized software for booking, client management, consent forms, and payments. MyTattoo.Software combines all these tools in one platform built specifically for the tattoo industry. Solo artists see 30% revenue increases through 24/7 online booking and 70% fewer no-shows with automated deposit collection. The software includes Instagram integration, mobile apps, digital consent forms, and reference image storage.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Do solo tattoo artists need software?",
    answer: "Yes—solo artists often need software more than studios. Without a receptionist or manager, you're handling all admin yourself. Software automates booking, reminders, and client management so you can focus on tattooing. Solo artists save 8+ hours weekly on admin tasks and see 75% client retention rates vs 47% industry average when using client management systems.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Solo artist features', url: '/features/' },
      { text: 'Time savings calculator', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does tattoo artist software cost?",
    answer: "Tattoo artist software typically costs £20-80 per month for solo artists. Look for flat monthly pricing with no per-booking fees—those add up quickly as you get busier. MyTattoo.Software offers simple pricing with all features included. Most solo artists see positive ROI within 2 weeks through prevented no-shows alone. One £100 no-show prevented pays for 3+ months of software.",

      { text: 'View pricing plans', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'ROI calculator', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use tattoo software as a guest artist?",
    answer: "Yes, good tattoo software works perfectly for guest artists. Take your client list and booking system with you wherever you work. Some software even handles multiple locations, letting you open booking for specific dates at new cities. Announce guest spots on Instagram, share your booking link, and collect deposits before you arrive. Your clients follow you, not the shop.",

      { text: 'Guest artist features', url: '/features/' },
      { text: 'Mobile booking guide', url: '/blog/tattoo-booking-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Is there free tattoo artist software?",
    answer: "Free options exist but come with severe limitations—usually no deposit collection, limited clients (5-10), or no SMS reminders. For serious artists, the £30-50/month investment pays for itself with one prevented no-show. Free software often charges per-booking fees (3-5%) that cost more than flat monthly pricing once you're busy. 78% of artists using free tools upgrade within 3 months.",

      { text: 'Free vs paid comparison', url: '/blog/free-tattoo-booking-app-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer: "Most solo artists complete setup in 10-20 minutes. You'll set your availability, customize service types and pricing, upload your logo/banner, and add the booking link to your Instagram bio. Clients can start booking immediately. No technical skills required—if you can post on Instagram, you can set up MyTattoo.Software. Mobile app makes management easy from your phone between clients.",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize my booking page?",
    answer: "Yes, good software lets you customize your booking page with your logo, brand colors, banner image, and custom text. Your booking page should match your Instagram aesthetic and personal brand. You control service names, descriptions, pricing, session lengths, and what information clients provide at booking. Some software even lets you add custom booking form fields.",

      { text: 'Booking page examples', url: '/blog/tattoo-booking-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I'm fully booked?",
    answer: "Good software handles full calendars intelligently. When no slots are available, clients can join a waitlist and get notified when cancellations open up. You can also close booking for specific periods (vacations, guest spots, conventions) while keeping your page active. Some artists open booking 2-3 months in advance, others keep it rolling. You control availability settings to match your working style.",

      { text: 'Calendar management guide', url: '/blog/tattoo-booking-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How do deposits work?",
    answer: "Clients pay deposits via card when booking online. You set deposit amounts per service type (e.g., £50 for consultations, £100-200 for sessions). Deposits are either deducted from final payment or kept as non-refundable commitment. Payment processing fees are typically 2.9% + 30p per transaction. Deposits reduce no-shows by 70% because clients have financial commitment at booking time.",

      { text: 'Payment processing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export my client data?",
    answer: "Yes, professional software lets you export client data in standard formats (CSV, Excel) so you're never locked in. Your client list, appointment history, and contact information should be exportable anytime. This is important if you switch software or want to analyze your business data. Good software sees your data as yours, not theirs. Always check export capabilities before committing.",

        <h2 id="what-is" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mb-6">What Is Tattoo Artist Software?</h2>

        <p><strong>Tattoo artist software</strong> is a business management platform designed for independent tattoo artists. It handles the admin side of running a tattoo business—booking, client records, consent forms, payments—so you can spend more time tattooing and less time on your phone.</p>

        <p>Unlike generic business tools, tattoo artist software understands the specific needs of the industry: deposit collection, reference image storage, multi-hour appointments, health questionnaires, and aftercare communication.</p>

        <h2 id="solo-vs-studio" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Solo Artist vs. Studio Software</h2>

        <p>Not all tattoo software is created equal. Solo artists have different needs than multi-artist studios.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What Solo Artists Need</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Simple booking:</strong> One calendar, one artist, no complexity</li>
          <li><strong>Personal branding:</strong> Your booking page, your style</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile-first:</strong> Manage everything from your phone</li>
          <li><strong>Affordable pricing:</strong> No paying for features you don't need</li>
          <li><strong>Quick setup:</strong> Working in minutes, not days</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What You Don't Need</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Multi-artist scheduling and permissions</li>
          <li>Staff payroll and commission tracking</li>
          <li>Complex reporting dashboards</li>
          <li>Inventory management for supplies</li>
          <li>Front desk features</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
          <p class="font-bold text-brand-navy mb-2">The Right Amount of Features</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Good software for solo artists includes everything you need and nothing you don't. You shouldn't pay extra for studio features or deal with a cluttered interface built for larger operations.</p>

        <h2 id="booking" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Online Booking for Solo Artists</h2>

        <p>Online booking is the single biggest time-saver for independent artists. Instead of DM tennis, clients see your availability and book themselves.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">How It Works</h3>

        <ol class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>1. Share your booking link</strong> — Instagram bio, website, Linktree, business cards</li>
          <li><strong>2. Client selects appointment type</strong> — consultation, small piece, large session</li>
          <li><strong>3. Picks from your available times</strong> — real-time availability, no conflicts</li>
          <li><strong>4. Pays deposit</strong> — card payment, instantly in your account</li>
          <li><strong>5. You get notified</strong> — email, SMS, or app notification</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-brand-red p-4 my-6">
          <p class="font-bold text-brand-navy">The Instagram Bio Link</p>
          <p>Most tattoo clients find artists on Instagram. A booking link in your bio converts followers into paying clients while you sleep. "DM to book" loses clients to faster-responding competitors.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="client-management" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Client Management</h2>

        <p>Build lasting relationships with clients by remembering everything about them.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What to Track</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Contact info:</strong> Phone, email, Instagram handle, preferred contact method</li>
          <li><strong>Tattoo history:</strong> Every piece you've done, with photos and notes</li>
          <li><strong>Reference images:</strong> Ideas they've shared for future work</li>
          <li><strong>Health info:</strong> Allergies, skin conditions, medications that affect healing</li>
          <li><strong>Session notes:</strong> Ink brands, needle sizes, how they healed</li>
          <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Music they like, if they need breaks, pain tolerance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Why This Matters</h3>

        <p>Returning clients are your most valuable asset. When someone comes back for their third piece and you remember their previous tattoos, their healing patterns, and that they like coffee during long sessions—that's the kind of experience that creates lifelong clients and referrals.</p>

        <h2 id="consent-forms" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Digital Consent Forms</h2>

        <p>Every tattoo needs informed consent. Digital forms are faster, more secure, and never get lost.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Benefits Over Paper</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Clients sign before arriving:</strong> Save 10-15 minutes per appointment</li>
          <li><strong>Never lost:</strong> Cloud storage means forms are safe forever</li>
          <li><strong>Easy to search:</strong> Find any form in seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Health screening:</strong> Capture allergies, medications, conditions automatically</li>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Age verification (18+ or legal guardian consent)</li>
          <li>Medical history questionnaire</li>

        <h2 id="guest-artists" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Software for Guest Artists</h2>

        <p>Traveling artists and guest spot tattooers have unique needs. Your software should work wherever you do.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Guest Artist Requirements</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Portable client list:</strong> Your clients follow you, not the shop</li>
          <li><strong>Location flexibility:</strong> Book for different cities and shops</li>
          <li><strong>Independent deposits:</strong> Payments come to you, not the host shop</li>
          <li><strong>Travel scheduling:</strong> Block time for travel and set location-specific availability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Announcing Guest Spots</h3>

        <p>Good software lets you open booking for specific dates at a new location. Announce your guest spot on Instagram, share the booking link, and let clients in that city book directly with deposit—all before you arrive.</p>
