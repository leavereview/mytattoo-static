    question: "What is a tattoo booking app?",
    answer: "A tattoo booking app is a mobile-friendly system that lets clients book tattoo appointments online, view artist portfolios, submit design references, pay deposits, and manage their bookings—all from their phone. 85% of tattoo bookings now come from mobile devices, and clients complete the entire booking process in 3 minutes on average. Modern booking apps integrate deposit collection, automated reminders, and reference image uploads in one seamless flow.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a separate app or is a mobile website enough?",
    answer: "For most tattoo studios, a mobile-optimized booking website works perfectly. Clients don't need to download anything from app stores, and you avoid Apple/Google fees (30% commission). A responsive web-based booking portal gives you all the benefits of an app—works on phones, can be added to home screen, sends notifications—without the complications. 94% of clients prefer this over messaging back and forth.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Mobile booking features', url: '/features/' },
      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can clients submit tattoo ideas through a booking app?",
    answer: "Yes, good tattoo booking systems include image upload features so clients can share reference images, placement photos, and design ideas when they book. This gives you everything you need before the consultation—concept inspiration, size preferences, budget expectations, and placement. Images are organized per booking (not lost in DM threads) and accessible on both mobile and desktop for your design work.",

      { text: 'Reference upload features', url: '/features/' },
      { text: 'Design workflow guide', url: '/blog/tattoo-booking-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How do booking apps handle deposits?",
    answer: "Booking apps require deposits at time of booking, either as fixed amounts (£50, £100, £200) or percentages of estimated cost. Deposits are collected via integrated card payment and automatically tracked. You control refund policies: non-refundable for no-shows, refundable with X days notice, or transferable to rescheduled appointments. Deposits reduce no-shows by 70% because clients have financial commitment at booking time. Payment processing fees are typically 2.9% + 30p.",

      { text: 'Deposit best practices', url: '/blog/tattoo-deposit-guide/' },
      { text: 'Payment processing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a tattoo booking app cost?",
    answer: "Tattoo booking software typically costs £20-80 per month for solo artists, £80-150 for studios. MyTattoo.Software offers flat monthly pricing with no per-booking fees, so costs don't increase as you get busier. Avoid platforms charging 3-5% per booking—these add up to hundreds monthly for busy artists. Most artists save 9+ hours weekly managing bookings, making the ROI positive within 2-3 weeks through time savings and prevented no-shows.",

      { text: 'ROI calculator', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can clients reschedule through the app?",
    answer: "Yes, clients can reschedule appointments within your policy limits (e.g., up to 48 hours before). They click a reschedule link from their confirmation email or reminder, see alternative available times, and select a new slot. You're notified automatically and your calendar updates instantly. This saves endless DM back-and-forth. You control whether deposits transfer to new appointments, how close to appointments clients can reschedule, and minimum notice requirements.",

      { text: 'Scheduling guide', url: '/tattoo-scheduling-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't have a website?",
    answer: "You don't need a website to use booking apps. Most tattoo artists just add their booking link to Instagram bio, Linktree, or directly in their profile. The booking page itself serves as your online presence—clients see your portfolio, read your policies, and book appointments all in one place. Many successful artists operate Instagram-only with just a booking link. The booking page is mobile-friendly and can be customized with your logo and brand colors.",

      { text: 'Bio link best practices', url: '/blog/tattoo-booking-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How do I add my booking link to Instagram?",
    answer: "Add your booking link to your Instagram bio—this is prime real estate for converting followers to bookings. Go to Edit Profile > Website, paste your booking link. Consider using Linktree if you need multiple links (booking + portfolio site). 40% of bookings happen via Instagram bio links vs 15% for DM-only booking. Update your pinned story with booking instructions. You can also add booking links to posts and stories (Instagram allows link stickers for all accounts).",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the booking page design?",
    answer: "Yes, professional booking apps let you customize your booking page with your logo, brand colors, banner image, and custom text. Your booking page should match your Instagram aesthetic. You control service names and descriptions, booking form fields (collect what you need), policy text, and confirmation email branding. Some platforms offer advanced customization (custom CSS, domain mapping) but basic branding features are standard. Setup takes 10-15 minutes.",

    question: "Do I need technical skills to set it up?",
    answer: "No, tattoo booking apps are designed for artists, not developers. If you can post on Instagram, you can set up booking. Setup takes 10-20 minutes: enter your availability, add service types (consultation, small piece, half-day, full-day), set deposit amounts, upload your logo, get your booking link. Most platforms have onboarding guides with screenshots. Mobile apps let you manage everything from your phone. No coding, no website hosting, no technical knowledge required.",

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          A <strong>tattoo booking app</strong> is a mobile-optimized platform that lets clients schedule tattoo appointments online. Instead of messaging back and forth on Instagram or playing phone tag, clients visit your booking page, choose an available slot, submit their design ideas, pay a deposit, and confirm—all in one seamless flow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          The best tattoo booking apps integrate with your existing workflow. They sync with your calendar, collect the information you need upfront (design references, placement, size, budget), and protect your time with automatic deposits. At MyTattoo.Software, we've built booking tools specifically for the tattoo industry, understanding that a tattoo booking is very different from a haircut or spa appointment.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What to Look For</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Built for tattoo:</strong> Generic booking tools miss tattoo-specific needs</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile-first design:</strong> Your clients are booking from their phones</li>
          <li><strong>Deposit integration:</strong> Collecting deposits should be seamless, not an afterthought</li>
          <li><strong>Image uploads:</strong> Clients need to submit reference images</li>
          <li><strong>Customizable forms:</strong> Collect the specific information you need</li>
          <li><strong>Flat pricing:</strong> Avoid per-booking fees that punish success</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Red Flags</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-2 mb-8">
          <li>No deposit collection or clunky integration</li>
          <li>No way to upload reference images</li>
          <li>Desktop-focused design that's awkward on mobile</li>
          <li>Per-booking fees that increase with volume</li>
          <li>No automated reminders</li>
        </ul>
