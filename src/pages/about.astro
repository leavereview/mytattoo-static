          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
            We built MyTattoo.Software because we saw tattoo artists drowning in admin work when they should be focusing on creating art.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Founded in 2024, our mission is simple: give tattoo studios and artists the tools they need to run efficiently, reduce no-shows, and focus on what matters - creating incredible tattoos.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Our Values</h2>
          <ul class="space-y-3 mb-6">
