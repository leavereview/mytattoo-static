    question: "What is tattoo scheduling software?",
    answer: "Tattoo scheduling software is a digital system that manages appointments for tattoo studios and artists. It handles online booking, calendar management, automated reminders, deposit collection, and multi-artist coordination. Studios save 10+ hours weekly on booking admin and reduce no-shows by 65% with automated SMS reminders. The software prevents double-bookings, optimizes calendar utilization, and lets clients book 24/7.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does scheduling software reduce no-shows?",
    answer: "Scheduling software reduces no-shows by 65% through automated SMS and email reminders before appointments. Combined with deposit collection at booking time, clients have financial commitment and timely reminders. Studios can customize reminder timing (e.g., 48 hours + 24 hours + 2 hours before). Clients can confirm or reschedule via reminder links, giving you time to fill cancelled slots.",
    links: [
      { text: 'No-show reduction guide', url: '/blog/reduce-no-shows-tattoo-studio/' },
      { text: 'Reminder settings', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can clients book appointments themselves?",
    answer: "Yes, modern tattoo scheduling software includes online booking portals where clients view real-time availability, select services, choose their preferred artist, and book appointments 24/7 without calling or messaging. 35% of bookings happen outside business hours (evenings, weekends). Clients pay deposits at booking and receive instant confirmation. Your Instagram bio link, website, and Google listing all direct to your booking page.",

      { text: 'Booking software guide', url: '/tattoo-booking-software/' },
      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does scheduling software work for multiple artists?",
    answer: "Yes, good scheduling software manages individual calendars for each artist while providing studio owners unified oversight. Each artist sets their own availability, service pricing, and working hours. Clients can filter artists by specialty (realism, traditional, blackwork) and book with their preferred artist. The system prevents double-bookings across artists sharing workstations and provides studio-level reporting on utilization and revenue per artist.",

      { text: 'Multi-artist features', url: '/features/' },
      { text: 'Studio software guide', url: '/tattoo-studio-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does tattoo scheduling software cost?",
    answer: "Tattoo scheduling software typically costs £20-80 per month depending on features and studio size. MyTattoo.Software offers flat monthly pricing with no per-booking fees, so costs stay predictable as you get busier. Avoid software with per-booking fees (2-5% per appointment) that punish success—these add up to hundreds monthly for busy studios. Most studios achieve positive ROI within 2-3 weeks through time savings and prevented no-shows.",

      { text: 'ROI calculator', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can clients reschedule their own appointments?",
    answer: "Yes, good scheduling software lets clients reschedule within your policy limits (e.g., up to 48 hours before appointment). They click a reschedule link, see available alternative times, and select a new slot. You're notified automatically and the change appears in your calendar instantly. This saves back-and-forth messaging. You control whether deposits transfer to new appointments and how close to the appointment clients can reschedule.",

      { text: 'Cancellation policies', url: '/blog/tattoo-deposit-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to cancelled appointments?",
    answer: "When appointments are cancelled, the software can automatically notify waitlist clients about the opened slot. You control deposit refund policies (non-refundable, refundable with X days notice, transferable to new booking). The system tracks cancellation patterns to identify chronic cancellers. You can set minimum notice periods (e.g., 48 hours) and enforce deposit forfeiture for late cancellations. Calendar automatically updates and shows the slot as available.",

      { text: 'Deposit policies', url: '/blog/tattoo-deposit-guide/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance can clients book?",
    answer: "You control booking windows—common settings are 1-6 months in advance. Popular artists often open booking 2-3 months ahead, while guest artists might open booking for specific dates only. You can close booking temporarily (vacation, guest spot elsewhere, fully booked) while keeping your page active. Some studios use rolling availability (always show next 90 days) while others open specific booking windows quarterly.",

      { text: 'Guest artist guide', url: '/tattoo-artist-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does scheduling sync with Google Calendar?",
    answer: "Yes, most professional scheduling software offers two-way Google Calendar sync. Appointments booked in your tattoo software appear in Google Calendar automatically, and personal events from Google Calendar can block availability in your booking page. This prevents double-bookings when you have personal commitments. Sync also works with Apple iCal and other calendar apps. Changes sync in real-time or within 15 minutes depending on the platform.",

      { text: 'Integration guide', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I set different availability for each artist?",
    answer: "Yes, each artist gets individual availability settings. One artist might work Tuesday-Saturday 12-8pm while another works Monday-Friday 10-6pm. Artists can block personal time off, set recurring unavailability (e.g., every Wednesday morning for therapy), and adjust availability by season. Studio owners can view all artist calendars in unified view to monitor utilization and identify busy/slow periods across the shop.",

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>Tattoo scheduling software</strong> is a digital system that manages appointments for tattoo studios and individual artists. It replaces paper diaries, phone-based booking, and scattered DM conversations with a centralised calendar that clients can book directly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">
          Beyond basic scheduling, modern tattoo software integrates deposit collection, automated reminders, client records, and multi-artist management. The goal is simple: spend less time on admin and more time tattooing.
