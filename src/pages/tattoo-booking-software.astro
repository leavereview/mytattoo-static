// Enhanced FAQ Items

  {
    question: "What is tattoo booking software?",
    answer: "Tattoo booking software lets clients book appointments online 24/7, pay deposits, and receive automatic confirmations. It replaces DMs, phone calls, and manual scheduling with an automated system that works while you sleep. Modern platforms integrate with Instagram, collect deposits at booking, and send automated SMS reminders.",
    links: [
      { text: 'View all features', url: '/features/' },
      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does tattoo booking software cost?",
    answer: "Tattoo booking software typically costs £20-80 per month. MyTattoo.Software offers flat monthly pricing (Solo Artist £29, Studio £79) with unlimited bookings—no per-booking fees that punish your success. All plans include deposit collection, automated reminders, and Instagram integration.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Full pricing details', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can clients pay deposits when booking?",
    answer: "Yes, good tattoo booking software collects deposits automatically at the time of booking. This dramatically reduces no-shows by 70% because clients have financial commitment from the start. You can set custom deposit amounts (flat £50 or percentage like 20%) and define your cancellation policy.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Deposit management features', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Will booking software reduce no-shows?",
    answer: "Yes, deposit collection combined with automated SMS reminders reduces no-shows by 70% or more. A £50 deposit makes clients much more likely to show up or properly cancel. The system sends reminders 48 hours, 24 hours, and 2 hours before appointments, giving clients multiple chances to confirm or reschedule.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Reminder features', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use booking software with Instagram?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Put your booking link in your Instagram bio and link stickers. Clients tap the link, see your real-time availability, and book instantly without DM back-and-forth. Instagram bio link bookings convert at 40% vs 15% for DM-based booking.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Instagram integration', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Does tattoo booking software work for consultations?",
    answer: "Yes. Create different appointment types (consultation, small piece, half-day session, touch-up) with custom durations and deposit amounts. Consultations can be free or low-cost (£20) to qualify leads, while full sessions require higher deposits (£50-100).",
    links: [
      { text: 'Appointment types', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can clients upload reference images when booking?",
    answer: "Yes, modern tattoo booking software includes reference image upload at booking time. Clients attach inspiration photos, existing tattoo photos, or placement ideas. This eliminates separate DM chains for sharing images and ensures you have everything before the appointment.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Client intake features', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Is there booking software for tattoo studios with multiple artists?",
    answer: "Yes. Studio plans support multiple artists with individual calendars, booking pages, and deposit settings. Clients select their preferred artist (or choose 'first available') when booking. The Studio Plan (£79/month) handles up to 5 artists.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Studio plan details', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Multi-artist features', url: '/tattoo-studio-software/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a client cancels?",
    answer: "You define the cancellation policy. Typically: free cancellation with 48+ hours notice, deposit forfeit with 24-48 hours notice, full deposit forfeit for no-shows. The software applies your policy automatically and tracks no-shows for repeat offenders.",
    links: [
      { text: 'Cancellation policy features', url: '/features/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How does tattoo booking software compare to Calendly or Square?",
    answer: "Generic booking tools lack tattoo-specific features: reference image collection, digital consent forms, proper multi-hour session handling, and deposit policies that match industry norms. Tattoo-specific software is built for how artists actually work, not generic appointments.",

        <h2 id="what-is" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mb-6">What Is Tattoo Booking Software?</h2>

        <p><strong>Tattoo booking software</strong> is an online system that lets clients schedule appointments, pay deposits, and receive confirmations automatically. Instead of endless DM chains and phone tag, clients see your real availability and book when it works for them.</p>

        <p>The best tattoo booking software is built specifically for the industry—handling consultations, multi-hour sessions, deposit collection, and appointment types that generic tools like Calendly can't manage properly.</p>

        <h2 id="why-need" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Why You Need Online Booking</h2>

        <p>You became a tattoo artist to create art, not spend hours managing a calendar. Without proper booking software, you're leaving money on the table and burning out on admin.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">The Problem With DM Booking</h3>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-brand-red p-4 my-6">
          <p class="font-bold text-brand-navy">Every ignored DM is lost revenue</p>
          <p>While you're tattooing, potential clients are messaging you. By the time you reply, they've often booked with someone else. Online booking captures these clients while you work.</p>
        </div>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Time sink:</strong> 5-10 messages to book one appointment. That's hours per week on scheduling alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Lost bookings:</strong> Clients want to book at 11pm when they're browsing Instagram. DMs don't convert at midnight.</li>
          <li><strong>No deposits = no-shows:</strong> Without payment at booking, 20-30% of appointments never happen.</li>
          <li><strong>Double bookings:</strong> Keeping track manually means mistakes. Software eliminates conflicts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Benefits of Booking Software</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>24/7 booking</strong> — wake up to confirmed, paid appointments</li>
          <li><strong>70% fewer no-shows</strong> — deposits and reminders work</li>
          <li><strong>Zero scheduling conflicts</strong> — real-time availability updates</li>
          <li><strong>More time for art</strong> — stop being a full-time administrator</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="how-works" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">How Online Booking Works</h2>

        <p>Modern tattoo booking software creates a seamless experience for both you and your clients.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">The Client Experience</h3>

        <ol class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>1. Client clicks your booking link</strong> — from Instagram bio, website, or Google listing</li>
          <li><strong>2. Selects appointment type</strong> — consultation, small piece, half-day session, touch-up</li>
          <li><strong>3. Picks available time</strong> — sees your real-time availability, no guessing</li>
          <li><strong>4. Enters their info</strong> — contact details, tattoo description, reference images</li>
          <li><strong>5. Pays deposit</strong> — secure card payment processed instantly</li>
          <li><strong>6. Receives confirmation</strong> — email and SMS with all appointment details</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What You See</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>New booking notification (email, SMS, or app)</li>
          <li>Deposit automatically in your account</li>
          <li>Client info and reference images stored</li>
          <li>Calendar updated with no conflicts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="deposits" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Deposit Collection</h2>

        <p>Deposit collection is the single most important feature of booking software. Without it, you're gambling on every appointment.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Why Deposits Matter</h3>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
          <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-navy mb-2">$500 session × 20% no-show rate = $100 lost per booking</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">If you do 20 sessions a month without deposits, that's $2,000+ in lost income. A $50-100 deposit fixes this problem almost entirely.</p>
        </div>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Financial commitment:</strong> Clients who pay upfront show up. Period.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional image:</strong> Deposits signal that your time is valuable.</li>
          <li><strong>Cancellation protection:</strong> Keep the deposit if they no-show without notice.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash flow:</strong> Deposits provide predictable income before sessions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Deposit Best Practices</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Amount:</strong> $50-100 or 20-30% of estimated total</li>
          <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Non-refundable, applies to session cost</li>
          <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Required at booking, not later</li>
          <li><strong>Clear terms:</strong> State your cancellation policy upfront</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="no-shows" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Reducing No-Shows</h2>

        <p>Booking software attacks no-shows from multiple angles—not just deposits.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Automated Reminders</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>48 hours before:</strong> Email reminder with appointment details</li>
          <li><strong>24 hours before:</strong> SMS reminder with confirmation request</li>
          <li><strong>2 hours before:</strong> Final SMS with address and parking info</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Studies show that SMS reminders alone reduce no-shows by 30-40%. Combined with deposits, you can cut no-shows by 70% or more.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Easy Rescheduling</h3>

        <p>Give clients a simple way to reschedule if something comes up. It's better than a no-show. Good software includes self-service rescheduling with reasonable notice requirements.</p>

        <h2 id="features" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Key Features to Look For</h2>

        <h2 id="choosing" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Choosing the Right Software</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Built for Tattoo vs. Generic</h3>

        <p>Generic booking tools (Calendly, Acuity, Square Appointments) work for basic scheduling but lack tattoo-specific features:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Reference image collection at booking</li>
          <li>Digital consent forms integrated with appointments</li>
          <li>Proper handling of multi-hour sessions</li>
          <li>Deposit policies that match industry norms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What to Avoid</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Per-booking fees:</strong> Punishes success. Flat monthly is better.</li>
          <li><strong>No deposit collection:</strong> The most important feature. Non-negotiable.</li>
          <li><strong>No SMS reminders:</strong> Email-only reminders get ignored.</li>
          <li><strong>Complicated setup:</strong> If it takes more than an hour to configure, it's too complex.</li>
        </ul>
