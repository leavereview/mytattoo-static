    question: "What is tattoo studio software?",
    answer: "Tattoo studio software is an all-in-one platform that handles booking, client management, consent forms, deposits, reminders, and business reporting for tattoo shops. It replaces paper files, spreadsheets, and scattered DMs with one integrated system. Modern platforms include multi-artist calendar management, digital consent forms, reference image storage, and automated appointment reminders that reduce no-shows by 70%.",

      { text: 'See pricing', url: '/pricing/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How much does tattoo studio software cost?",
    answer: "Tattoo studio software typically costs £29-150 per month depending on features and studio size. MyTattoo.Software offers flat monthly pricing with all features included—no per-artist, per-booking, or per-client fees. Multi-artist studios save 35% more revenue compared to manual systems through better booking utilization and reduced no-shows. Most studios achieve positive ROI within the first month.",

      { text: 'View pricing plans', url: '/pricing/' },
      { text: 'Calculate ROI', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can clients book appointments online?",
    answer: "Yes, modern tattoo studio software lets clients book 24/7, view artist availability, select services (consultation, small piece, large session, touch-up), and pay deposits—all without you lifting a finger. Instagram bio links to booking pages convert at 40% vs 15% for DM-only booking. Clients can book while you sleep, and wake up to confirmed appointments with deposits already collected.",

      { text: 'Booking software guide', url: '/tattoo-booking-software/' },
      { text: 'Start free trial', url: '/contact/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need separate software for consent forms?",
    answer: "No, good tattoo studio software includes digital consent forms that clients sign electronically before appointments. Forms are stored securely in the cloud, linked to client profiles, and include timestamped signatures with IP address logging for legal protection. Digital forms save 2-3 hours weekly vs paper forms and can never be lost. Clients complete health questionnaires before arriving, saving valuable session time.",

      { text: 'Legal compliance', url: '/blog/tattoo-studio-compliance/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Will this work for a multi-artist studio?",
    answer: "Yes, tattoo studio software is designed for both solo artists and multi-artist shops. Each artist can have their own calendar, availability settings, service pricing, and client base while studio owners maintain oversight of the whole operation. Studios with 3+ artists using management software see 35% revenue increases through better calendar utilization, reduced scheduling conflicts, and improved client retention.",

      { text: 'Studio management guide', url: '/blog/managing-tattoo-studio/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "How do deposits reduce no-shows?",
    answer: "Deposits reduce no-shows by 70% because clients have financial commitment at booking. When deposits are collected automatically during online booking, clients are far less likely to forget or cancel last-minute. A studio doing 100 appointments monthly with 20% no-show rate loses £2,000+ monthly (assuming £100 average deposit). With deposit-based booking, that drops to £600—saving £1,400 monthly or £16,800 annually.",

      { text: 'Deposit best practices', url: '/blog/tattoo-deposits/' }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "Can artists have separate calendars?",
    answer: "Yes, each artist gets their own calendar with individual availability settings, time off management, and service offerings. Artists can block personal time, set different hourly rates for different services, and manage their own client bookings. Studio owners can view all calendars at once to monitor utilisation, identify gaps, and ensure optimal studio scheduling without micromanaging individual artists.",

  },
  {
    question: "What reports can studio owners access?",
    answer: "Studio owners get comprehensive business reporting including revenue per artist, booking conversion rates, no-show patterns, popular service types, client retention metrics, and average session values. Reports help identify which artists are busiest, which services are most profitable, peak booking times, and revenue trends. This data-driven approach helps optimize pricing, artist scheduling, and marketing spend for maximum profitability.",

  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer: "Most tattoo studios complete setup in 15-30 minutes. You'll add artist profiles, set availability, customize services and pricing, upload your logo, and add the booking link to your Instagram bio. Clients can start booking immediately. For multi-artist studios, each artist spends 5-10 minutes setting their own availability and preferences. No technical skills required—if you can post on Instagram, you can set up MyTattoo.Software.",

  {
    question: "Can we keep our existing website?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. MyTattoo.Software works alongside your existing website—you simply add a 'Book Now' button that links to your booking page. Most studios also add the booking link to their Instagram bio, Google Business Profile, and Facebook page. You don't need to change your website at all. Many studios don't even have a website—they use Instagram as their main presence with the booking link in their bio.",

        <h2 id="what-is" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mb-6">What Is Tattoo Studio Software?</h2>

        <p><strong>Tattoo studio software</strong> is a comprehensive platform designed specifically for tattoo shops and artists. It handles everything from booking and scheduling to consent forms, client records, payments, and business analytics.</p>

        <p>Unlike generic booking tools (Calendly, Acuity) or piecing together multiple apps, tattoo studio software understands the unique needs of the industry: deposit collection, health questionnaires, reference image storage, multi-hour session management, and aftercare communication.</p>

        <h2 id="why-need" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Why Your Studio Needs Proper Software</h2>

        <p>You became a tattoo artist to create art, not spend evenings chasing deposits and filing consent forms. Without the right tools, admin work eats into your creative time and income.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">The Cost of Not Having Software</h3>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-brand-red p-4 my-6">
          <p class="font-bold text-brand-navy">No-shows cost money</p>
          <p>A single no-show on a $500 session hurts. With a 20% no-show rate (common without deposits), a busy artist loses $2,000+ monthly. Proper booking software with deposits cuts no-shows by 70%.</p>
        </div>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Lost bookings:</strong> While you're tattooing, potential clients are DMing competitors who respond faster.</li>
          <li><strong>Admin overwhelm:</strong> Hours spent managing DMs, texts, emails, and paper forms instead of tattooing.</li>
          <li><strong>Unprofessional image:</strong> Clients expect online booking. Paper consent forms feel dated.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal risk:</strong> Paper consent forms get lost. Digital forms are stored securely forever.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Benefits of Studio Software</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>70% fewer no-shows</strong> — deposits and automated reminders work</li>
          <li><strong>24/7 booking</strong> — wake up to confirmed appointments</li>
          <li><strong>Zero paperwork</strong> — digital consent forms, stored forever</li>
          <li><strong>More time for art</strong> — automate the admin, focus on tattooing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Online booking is the single most valuable feature for most studios. It eliminates the back-and-forth of scheduling while securing bookings with deposits.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">How It Works</h3>

        <ol class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>1. Client visits your booking page</strong> — linked from your Instagram bio, website, or Google listing</li>
          <li><strong>2. Selects service and artist</strong> — consultation, small piece, large session, touch-up</li>
          <li><strong>3. Chooses available time</strong> — sees real-time availability, picks what works</li>
          <li><strong>4. Pays deposit</strong> — card payment collected instantly</li>
          <li><strong>5. Receives confirmation</strong> — email and SMS with appointment details</li>

        <h2 id="consent-forms" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Digital Consent Forms</h2>

        <p>Every tattoo requires informed consent. Paper forms work, but they're easy to lose and hard to search. Digital consent forms solve these problems.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Benefits of Digital Forms</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Never lost:</strong> Forms stored securely in the cloud, accessible forever</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-appointment completion:</strong> Clients sign before arriving, saving session time</li>
          <li><strong>Health questionnaires:</strong> Capture allergies, medications, conditions automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Legal protection:</strong> Timestamped signatures with IP address logging</li>
          <li><strong>Easy retrieval:</strong> Find any consent form in seconds</li>

        <h2 id="client-management" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Client Management</h2>

        <p>Build lasting client relationships with comprehensive profiles that remember everything.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What to Track</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Contact info:</strong> Phone, email, Instagram handle</li>
          <li><strong>Tattoo history:</strong> Every piece you've done, with photos</li>
          <li><strong>Reference images:</strong> Ideas they've shared for future work</li>

        <h2 id="choosing" class="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-12 mb-6">Choosing the Right Software</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">What to Look For</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Built for tattoo:</strong> Generic booking tools lack consent forms, deposits, and industry-specific features.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile-friendly:</strong> You and your clients live on phones. The software should too.</li>
          <li><strong>Deposit collection:</strong> If it doesn't collect deposits at booking, no-shows will kill you.</li>
          <li><strong>Simple pricing:</strong> Avoid per-booking fees that punish success.</li>
          <li><strong>Free trial:</strong> Test with real clients before committing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-navy mt-8 mb-4">Red Flags</h3>
